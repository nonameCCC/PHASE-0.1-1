**********************************************************
*
* BCM61B
*
* Nexperia
*
* Matched double NPN/NPN Transistor
* IC   = 100 mA
* VCEO = 45 V
* hFE  = 200 - 450 @ 5V/2mA
*
*
*
*
* Package pinning does not match Spice model pinning.
* Package: SOT 143
*
* Package Pin 1:   Collector;Base   	TR2;TR1,TR2
* Package Pin 2:   Collector        	TR1
* Package Pin 3;4: Emitter          	TR1;TR2
*
*
* Extraction date (week/year): 27/2022
* Spicemodel includes temperature dependency
*

*#
* Please note: The following model is to be used twice in
* schematic due to equality of both Transistors.
*
* Diode D1, Transistor Q2 and resistor RQ
* are dedicated to improve modeling of quasi
* saturation area and reverse mode operation
* and do not reflect physical devices.
